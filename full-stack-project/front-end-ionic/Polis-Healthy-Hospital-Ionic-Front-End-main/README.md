## Polis app backend

1. Install nodejs & npm
2. Install ionic npm package
3. Run `npm install` in the terminal inside the `./Polis-Healthy-Hospital---Ionic-Front-End` directory
4. Run `ionic serve` to start the front end
After this http://localhost:4200 should open the home page

The backend in the repo `https://github.com/DonaldoruciUni/Polis-Healthy-Hospital` should be started before, 
it would usually run in http://localhost:8080, in any case if it changes 
update the file in the `/src/environments/environment.ts` with the new api url
